## Introduction
While working at Vizag Steel as an industrial engineer I got first-hand experience on the polluting impact of the steel and power industry. I designed simulations and wrote programs to reduce the plant’s overall carbon emissions. What stuck with me is that the steel industry contributes 3 Tons of CO2 for the production of 1 Ton of Crude steel. On the contrary, I am excited by the potential of the same CO2 emissions to be ‘electrolyzed’ into fuels, and petrochemicals instead. Eventually this process is reducing CO2 emissions in environment, thus making our environment better. So, I have decided to scrape the ranking of journals in the field of renewable energy, sustainability and environment.
